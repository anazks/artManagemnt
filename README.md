Please note that, this was my first ever project and thus you may find not so good architecture. I developed this project when I was learning web developement. Although, I tried to include as much things as possible, but still you may find that some data are not relevant. I would suggest you to delete all the data and come up with fresh entries. It is working project and it has foreign key constraints as well. If anyone wants to contribute to this project, please ping on my mail, I would love to collab. 
If you still have any query regarding this project then just mail me at iaashu98@gmail.com. I'm available there.
